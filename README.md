# Wind-Energy-Prediction-using-ML-with-R

This repository has been initially created to demonstrate, and shed light to, the programming parts of my Senior Undergraduate Thesis,
called "Evaluation of the Benefits from a Machine Learning Project for Wind Energy Prediction," which had been conducted in my last year
of undergraduate studies at the Department of International and European Economic Studies of the School of Economic Sciences at Athens
University of Economics and Business. The study had spanned one academic year, and finally, was submitted on time in September of 2019,
having been graded by my supervisor with High Distinction.
