# Wind-Energy-Prediction-using-ML-with-R

This repository has been initially created to demonstrate and shed light to the programming parts of my Senior Undergraduate Thesis,
called "Evaluation of the Benefits from a Machine Learning Project for Wind Energy Prediction", which had been conducted in my last year of studies at
Athens University of Economics and Business, School of Economic Sciences, Department of International and European Economic Studies. Greatfully,
this study was submitted on time in September of 2019 and graded by my supervisor, Prof. Phoebe Koundouri, with High Distinction.
